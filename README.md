# Faction Relations Overhaul - DLTX Update [1.2]

Overhauls the relations between factions so that they reflect better on the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Lore-established relations, but it does **not** follow them strictly, thus the inconsistencies such as Duty-Ecologists hostility exist.<br>

However, these changes are intentional, both because from the Faction lore perspective, said faction relationships should not be as they are, and to make the Zone a more dangerous place.<br>

Because of that, usage of the Disguise System is a must in order to venture in the hostile areas. This also makes care-free running around the Zone much more punishing, as the factions that used to be Neutral might now not be.<br>

## Installation 

1. Download the mod from [here](https://github.com/LessThanThree-OMG/factionrelationsoverhaul) (Click on the green "Code" button and then on "Download ZIP")
2. Install the mod through the Mod Organizer 2

Since this mod is now DLTX, the place in the Load Order is **not** important, although it's still probably going to be below the Base GAMMA files that contain the "game_relations.ltx" file.
