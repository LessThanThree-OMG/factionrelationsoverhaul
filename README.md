# Faction Relations Overhaul

Overhauls the relations between factions so that they reflect better on the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Lore-established relations.<br>
Because of that, it is making the Zone (quite) a bit more dangerous than usual since many factions have more enemies than in the Anomaly (G.A.M.M.A.), therefore an utilization of the Disguise system is a must.<br>
It also partially fixes the Sin-Mutants relations, making them neutral to each other in every level other than the Lab x16, where the mutants still attack the Sin, therefore in the runs with this mod installed, mutants will always win the fight with the Sin since they won't shoot at them.<br>

## Installation

1. Download the mod from [here](https://github.com/MVukanichh/factionrelationsoverhaul) (Click on the green "Code" button and then on "Download ZIP")
2. Install the mod through the Mod Organizer 2

By default in the default G.A.M.M.A. modlist, there are Two (2) mods that Faction Relations Overhaul must win the conflicts against ("161- Improved player and NPCs ranks (longer for player, faster for companions) - mandothreesixtee" and "G.A.M.M.A. Economy (don't disable, turn on Black Market to buy gear)"), therefore putting the mod anywhere below the "G.A.M.M.A. Economy and Craft" separator is acceptable but putting the mod as low in the load order as possible is recommended, as it must **not** lose any conflicts.
